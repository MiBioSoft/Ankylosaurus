============

You will want a development environment that can handle all of the following: HTML, PHP, MySQL, Python.

Check out LAMP development:
Linux
Apache HTTP Server
MySQL (or MariaDB)
PHP, Perl, Python (scripting languages)

Some suggestions, but there are PLENTY out there:
ActiveState Komodo (all platforms, subscription required. a good choice -- perhaps we can pull from the funding?)
NetBeans (all platforms, free. limited Python support)
phpDesigner (Windows only, free)
